> Formatting makes code easier to read by human beings. It applies specific rules and conventions for line spacing, indents, spacing around operators, and so on. You can view an example on the autopep8 page. Keep in mind, formatting doesn't affect the functionality of the code itself.

> Linting helps to prevent errors by analyzing code for common syntactical, stylistic, and functional errors and unconventional programming practices. Although there is a little overlap between formatting and linting, the two capabilities are complementary.

> Linting is thus distinct from Formatting because linting analyzes how the code runs and detects errors whereas formatting only restructures how code appears.
